# Automation Test For Google Search Engine
The automation test scripts are developed using Selenium + Java and integrated with Cucumber and testng. The project is designed to be independant from each other where the tester can run a test for any feature without the need to run the whole project. 

## 1. _Project Execution_
- To execute the project, the tester need to make sure that all JARs used in the project is added to the project locally.
- All the JARs needed can be found in the [JARs Folder]() in the repository.
- After confirming that the JARs are already added to the project, the tester should navigate to `main_Runner.java` file and run it as **JUnit Test**.
- The project will begin to run and execute the features one by one and shows their status in the **JUnit Side Menu**
- The test should be executed over a chrome browser of version 89.0.4389.90 or the tester will need to change the Browser driver in the BrowserDriver folder.

## 2. _Project Structure_
- The project contain 4 libraries and 3 folders.
- The four libraries are the **JRE System Library, JUnit 5, TestNG and the refrenced libraries** that contains all the JARs added to the project.
- The three folers are the `src` folder, `features`, `BrowserDrivers`
    1. The `src` folder contains all **.java** files and contains three packages
        1. The **mainPackage** that contains all objects created to be used in the project and the `baseClass.java` that contains all functions shared between all step definition classes.
        2. The **StepDefinition** that contains all classes that defines the steps executed in the project
        3. The **testRunner** that contains all runners for the projects
    2. The `Features` folder contains all the features files to be exectued according to their calls
    3. The `BrowserDrivers` that contains all browsers drivers to be used in the project.

## 3. _Automation Test Cases_
|#|Test Case|Expected Results|Actual Results|Status|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|1|Access the link of the Google Search main screen|The screen should opens normally|As Expected|Pass|
|2|Search using single word of **Instabug** as a keyword|The engine should open the results screen and shows results relevant to the keyword **Instabug**|As Expected|Pass|
|3|Search using multiple words as keywords|The engine should open the results screen and shows results relevant to the keywords|As Expected|Pass|
|4|input nothing in the search bar and submit the search|The engine should do nothing and wait for the user to insert some keywords|As Expected|Pass|
|5|insert some keyword and then clear the search bar then submit the search|The engine should do nothing and wait for the user to insert some keywords|As Expected|Pass|
|6|Search using single word as a keyword from the results screen|The engine should open the results screen and shows results relevant to the keyword|As Expected|Pass|
|7|Access the link of the Google Search main screen and check the country field in the footer|The country in the footer should be the local country of the machine|As Expected|Pass|
|8|Sign in to a google account with invalid email|The system should block the user from signing in and fire a toast that the email is not found|As Expected|Pass|
|9|Sign in to a google account with valid email and invalid password|The system should block the user from signing in and fire a toast that the password is not found|As Expected|Pass|
|10|Sign in to a google account with valid credentials|The user should sign in to their account and the system should direct them to the main search screen|As Expected|Pass|
|11|Images search using Instabug as a search keyword|The result screen should open filtered by images and the data should be relevant to **Instabug**|As Expected|Pass|
|12|Compare between the image search and the image filteration|The result of the two process should be the same and relevant to the search keyworf **Instabug**|As Expected|Pass|
